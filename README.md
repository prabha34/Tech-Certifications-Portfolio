# 🌟 My Certifications & Virtual Internships

Welcome to my **Tech Certifications Portfolio** – a repository where I showcase key certifications and virtual experiences I've completed from leading global companies.

These programs have been more than just badges. They were hands-on, challenge-driven learning journeys — simulating **real-world projects**, deadlines, and expectations. Each one gave me a taste of what it’s like to work inside top-tier tech-driven teams.

## 🖥️ J.P. Morgan – Software Engineering Virtual Experience

**What I learned:**
- Built a Spring Boot microservice that integrates Kafka, REST APIs, and H2 database.
- Handled transaction processing logic and created REST endpoints to serve balance queries.
- Understood real-world software lifecycle and backend engineering workflows.

**How it helped:**
This experience was like a mini-internship. I got to work on a **production-style codebase**, implement real APIs, write clean backend logic, and think like a software engineer working on financial systems.
